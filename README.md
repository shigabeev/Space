# Linear algebra refresher
This repo contains basic Linear algebra functions such as adding, finding perpendiculars.

The only purpose of it was to train my C++ and Linear algebra skills.

## Usage
After you clone the repository go to Terminal and type
    
    make main
    ./a.out
    
You'll get picture of filled triangle
![Triangle](https://pp.userapi.com/c836522/v836522039/63aca/0BAKCkntWLo.jpg)

Also it can draw vectors from center of screen and draw their projections one on another and its perpendiculars.

for that open main.cpp and uncomment lines for vectors main and comment lines for drawing triangle. (Yep, sorry for duct tape)

## Features
1. Contains basic functions performed on 2D vectors like dot product, perpedicular, and projections
2. Has flawless Bresengham line drawing algorithm
3. Has almost as good polygon drawing algorithm (triangle)
4. It has amazing lightweight class for drawing in TGA, whose only purpose in life is to set color of one pixel
